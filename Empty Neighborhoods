Weâ€™re given two tables, a users table with demographic information and the neighborhood they live in and a neighborhoods table.

Write a query that returns all neighborhoods that have 0 users. 

Example:

Input:

users table

Columns	Type
id	INTEGER
name	VARCHAR
neighborhood_id	INTEGER
created_at	DATETIME
neighborhoods table

Columns	Type
id	INTEGER
name	VARCHAR
city_id	INTEGER
Output:

Columns	Type
name	VARCHAR

Solution:

SELECT NAME FROM NEIGHBORHOODS
WHERE ID NOT IN (SELECT DISTINCT NEIGHBORHOODS_ID FROM USERS)
