Given a table of bank transactions with columns id, transaction_value, and created_at representing the date and time for each transaction, write a query to get the last transaction for each day.

The output should include the id of the transaction, datetime of the transaction, and the transaction amount. Order the transactions by datetime.

Example:

Input:

bank_transactions table

Column	Type
id	INTEGER
created_at	DATETIME
transaction_value	FLOAT
Output:

Column	Type
created_at	DATETIME
transaction_value	FLOAT
id	INTEGER

Solution:

SELECT * FROM BANK_TRANSACTIONS
WHERE CREATED_AT IN (SELECT MAX(CREATED_AT) FROM BANK_TRANSACTIONS GROUP BY DATE(CREATED_AT))
